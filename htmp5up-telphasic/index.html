								<h2>About Gabii</h2>								
							</header>
							<p>The Gabii Project in an ongoing archeological dig that began in 2007 through a cooperative effort from international 
							faculty headed by University of Michigan professor Nicola Terrenato. A key aspect of the archeological 
							research is to examine the similarities and differnces between Gabii its contemporary Latium cities. Connections to Rome
							are particularly important, though contextualizing the development of Gabii itself is of great importance, as well (University of Michigan).
							The team at Gabii is is on the cusp of archaeological practice, incorporating modern digital technologies to both 
							capture, document, and share data. Area A (one of the 5 areas that has been excavated at Gabii) is laid out in the Unity 
							scene to your right. The most notable finds in Area A include two infant tombs, each containing grave goods, oriented in the
							North-South direction. Both of the graves were inhumation burials, in which the bodies were placed into 
							a rectangular cut in the bedrock. The two infant burials in this area are difficult to contextualize due to the 
							stratigraphical disturbance the area has experienced from natural erosion and plowing in recent times (Mogetta & Becker 2014), but the grave goods displayed help us understand the 
							practice of funerary rituals in this Latin city during the Early Iron Age and point to the development of a social hierarchy that was inhereted 
							by descendants of the powerful and wealthy. Tomb 10 appears to date between Latial III and Latial IV periods (750-600 BC) (Becker & Nowlin 2014).

								<p>The practice of orientalizing infant graves points to a system that reflects inhereted social rank. 
								Tomb 10 (in the Unity scene above) and Tomb 11 are both orientalized infant graves in Area A. These
								graves help place the historical progression of Gabii's society in relation to other Latin cities.
								Commonalities in burial practices are most often related to the site at Osteria dell'Osa (Becker & Nowlin 2014).</p>

								</div>
								<p>In Tomb 10, a variety of grave goods were recovered including ten different ceramic vessels. Most of the ceramics recovered were impasto ceramics, a common Etruscan pottery technique dating to the Iron Age. These ceramics were handmade using clay that also contained stone. The majority of the ceramics were placed at the feet of the inhumation burial. Tomb 10 contained a variety of cups as well as a large basin ceramic. It is possible that these grave goods were meant to prepare the deceased for an afterlife.
								Some archaeologists theorize that vessels such as cups and pots were used to actually hold or symbolize food for sustanence in the next life (Pearson 1999).</p>

								</div>
								<p>Tomb 10 also contained multiple pieces of bronze ornamentation, many of which were placed on torso and upper body of the deceased. There were two lunate-shaped bronze necklaces placed on the torso of the deceased that appeared to have been connected to a bronze chain also found in the tomb. Placing bronze ornamentation on an infant burial like this was most likely a manner of showing elite status in society. Finding this type of ornamentation also suggests commonplace funerary practices of body adornment during this time.
								Adorning the body with jewelry such as the bronze pieces found in Tomb 10 are often thought to symbolize social order (Pearson 1999).</p>
