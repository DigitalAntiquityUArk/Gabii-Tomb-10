							<h2>So what is an "orientalized tomb?"</p>

								</div>
								<p>The practice of orientalizing infant graves points to a system that reflects inhereted social rank. 
								Tomb 10 (in the Unity scene above) and Tomb 11 are both orientalized infant graves in Area A. These
								graves help place the historical progression of Gabii's society in relation to other Latium cities.</p>

								<div class="image-wrapper">

								</div>
								<p>In Tomb 10, a variety of grave goods were recovered including ten different ceramic vessels. Most of the ceramics recovered were impasto ceramics, a common Etruscan pottery technique dating to the Iron Age. These ceramics were handmade using clay that also contained stone. The majority of the ceramics were placed at the feet of the inhumation burial. Tomb 10 contained a variety of cups as well as a large basin ceramic. It is possible that these grave goods were meant to prepare the deceased for an afterlife. </p>

								</div>
								<p>Tomb 10 also contained multiple pieces of bronze ornamentation, many of which were placed on the body of the deceased. There were two lunate-shaped bronze necklaces placed on the torso of the deceased that appeared to have been connected to a bronze chain also found in the tomb. Placing bronze ornamentation on an infant burial like this was most likely a manner of showing elite status in society. Finding this type of ornamentation also suggests commonplace funerary practices of body adornment during this time. </p>
