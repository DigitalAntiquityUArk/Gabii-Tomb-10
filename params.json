  "body": "The scene to the right allows you to walk up to and explore an infant burial in Area A of an archaeological site in Gabii, Italy. Tomb 10 is the older of the only two infant burials in Area A. Use the arrow keys to walk around the site, and click on the (however we decorate it) box above the model for more information.\r\nThere are two models of Tomb 10 in this scene. The models show different grave goods and other inclusions because the models were created by photographs taken at different stages during the excavation of the grave. The harris matrix below outlines the different layers and SUs (or soil units) that are included in the grave.\r\n\r\n## The Site at Gabii\r\nBrief info\r\nWant to know more?
